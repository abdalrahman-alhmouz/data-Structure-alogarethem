## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
- aeclare sum value ;
- - define hasEdge method 
 - check if the length of input array larger than 2;
- declare tow node  array ;

- loop in the edgeList ;
- check if the length of input array larger than 3;
- check if the first tow node have edge ;

- check if the third node have edge ;
- collect the  price ;
- return true;
 
- else check if the input tow node have edge ;
- collect the  price ;
- return true;
