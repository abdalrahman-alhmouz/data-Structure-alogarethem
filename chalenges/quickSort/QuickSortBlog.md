### Quicksort

Choose any element of the array to be the pivot.
Divide all other elements (except the pivot) into two partitions.
All elements less than the pivot must be in the first partition.
All elements greater than the pivot must be in the second partition.
Use recursion to sort both partitions.
Join the first sorted partition, the pivot, and the second sorted partition.
The code has two separate implementations of quicksort, that differ in the way synchronization is achieved

quicksort_sem(); Uses semaphores to synchronize child tasks (forced serialization)

quicksort(); Uses task priorities for synchronization (increases priority for children tasks)
