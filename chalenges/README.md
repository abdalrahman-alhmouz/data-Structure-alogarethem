 ### Merge Sort
 * merge sort is sorting algorithim uses divide and conquer
 * merge sort iterate on array recursively.
 #### mechanism
 * it split array into half each time method is called until i get single nodes.
 * merge items again recursively until i get the array strtuctured again as one block.
 * while merging nodesm it merge them in sorted order.
 #### Data
[45,12,9,20,1,98]
