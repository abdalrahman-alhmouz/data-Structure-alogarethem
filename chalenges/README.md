 # Selection Sort
 
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* Write a function called SelectionSort which takes a array then Sort this array  ;
  
 
 ## solve :

- creat  SelectionSort method () with array parameters ;
we evaluate if there is a smaller number in the array than what is currently present in index 0 ,
by tow for loop 
* . At the end of the evaluation, the smaller number will be swapped with the current value in index i. This results in our smallest number of our array being placed first.
* And so it is with the rest of the elements of the Array .
*
