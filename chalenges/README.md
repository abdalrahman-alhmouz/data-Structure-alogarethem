 # linked List  Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* In this challenge what is required is learn how we can traversal in a tree and adding elements.

  
 * Trees
Trees is a type of data structure and we have many types of tree in this code challenge we are dealing with binary tree.
Challenge
Approach & Efficiency

 ######### Here is description for each method in this code challenge :
preOrder: to traversal in the tree by following this approach root >> left >> right
inOrder:to traversal in the tree by following this approach left >> root >> right
postOrder:to traversal in the tree by following this approach left >> right >> root
add: this method to add take integer as input and add it in the correct location in the tree
contain: for checking if the provided value exist in the tree or not.
## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
 * self working

## Solution
<!-- Embedded whiteboard image -->
