 # linked List  Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
 * we need to write a Stack ,Queue And fill them in with  data. * <!-- Description of the challenge -->
 * i have created a class (NODE), (Stack) and (Queue), in the Node class i created a constructor which have (Value, Next).
In Stack class i, I did (push) the method that accepts the int number and assigns it to the first node etc., the pop method that deletes the last in, and the peek method that returns the last value.
In the Queue class I used the enQueue method that accepts the int number and assigns it to the first node etc., the deQueue method that deletes the first in, and the peek method that returns the first value.Finally, return the new linksList.
 .
