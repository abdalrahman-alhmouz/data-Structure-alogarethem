 # linked List  Array
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* we need to Create a class called MultiBracketValidation which have MultiBracketValidation method that check if the bracket closed or not .
  
 * Initially, I created a MultiBracket method that accepts a String to see if the arcs are balanced;
The first thing I did was use ArrayDeque <character>
Then for loop to loop in the String (each char) in the side of the loop for I declare char (x) which is equal to each character in the array, then check if the string contains any opean parentheses and push them to the Stack.
Then Swith case 
  With the first case ")"
Declare char check = stack.pop
If the check is equal to the other closed bracket type, return false and break the loop;
With a second letter "}"
Declare char check = stack.pop
If the check is equal to the other closed  bracket type, return false and break the loop;
With the third case "]"
Declare char check = stack.pop
If the check is equal to the other closed  bracket type, return false and break the loop;
## Approach & Efficiency
