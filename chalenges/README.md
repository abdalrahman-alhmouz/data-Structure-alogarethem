 <!-- Description of the challenge -->
* Create a method zipList that accepts a  tow LinkedList within this method, check if the linksList (current or currentOne)is not null and another two if statment each one must checked for current if it null or not for each linksList else assign first node in a new linksList by node one and assign secound node in linksList by nodeTow inside while loop (if the nodeOne or node Tow become null then the linksList will fill up with the one wich isnt null)
Finally, return the new linksList.
 .
