 # Tree
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
* In this challenge what is required is learn how we can traversal in a tree and adding elements.
####  Binary Tree

* Define a method for each of the depth first traversals called preOrder(), inOrder(), and postOrder() which returns an array of the values, ordered appropriately.

 #### Binary Search Tree :
* Define a method named add() that accepts a value, and adds a new node with that value in the correct location in the binary search tree.
 * Define a method named contains() that accepts a value, and returns a boolean indicating whether or not the value is in the tree at least once.

  
 * Trees
Trees is a type of data structure and we have many types of tree in this code challenge we are dealing with binary tree.
Challenge
Approach & Efficiency

 ###### Here is description for each method in this code challenge :
preOrder: to traversal in the tree by following this approach root >> left >> right
inOrder:to traversal in the tree by following this approach left >> root >> right
postOrder:to traversal in the tree by following this approach left >> right >> root
add: this method to add take integer as input and add it in the correct location in the tree
contain: for checking if the provided value exist in the tree or not.



Challenge
public Node{}
Node contain Integer value, Node left, Node right.
 * BinaryTree{}
contain 3 methods:
preOrder()
inOrder()
postOrder()

 * BinarySearchTree{}
constructor BinarySearchTree(){}
constructor BinarySearchTree(root){}
 - addNode method 
 - contain
## Approach & Efficiency
